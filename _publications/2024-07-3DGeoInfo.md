excerpt: >
    Urban digital twins, and 3D city models underpinning them, provide novel solutions to urban management but tend to overlook the human element. The trending research on human perception reveals people’s perspective towards interpreting and experiencing the built environment. Advancing the representation of building physics and descriptive information in 3D city models and urban digital twins, we establish the addition and integration of the notion of how humans perceive buildings. Unlocking a new dimension in our domain, this new concept can facilitate a broader adoption of semantic 3D data in socio-economic fields across various domains, and advance existing use cases in 3D GIS.
