excerpt: >
    Building characteristics, such as number of storeys and type, play a key role across many domains: interpreting urban form, simulating urban microclimate or modelling building energy. However, geospatial data on the building stock is often fragmented and incomplete. Here, we propose a novel and easily adaptable method to predict building characteristics in diverse cities, which attempts to mitigate such data gaps. Our method exploits the geospatial connectivity between street-level urban objects and building characteristics by employing graph neural networks, as they can model spatial relationships and leverage them for predictions. We apply this approach in three representative cities (Boston, Melbourne, and Helsinki) that offer a variety of building features as prediction targets (storeys, types, construction period and materials) and diverse urban environments as predictors.
