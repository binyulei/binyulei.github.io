excerpt: >
    Urban environments are increasingly recognised for their potential to support psychological restoration, yet most studies assess green and grey spaces in isolation and rely on static, lab-based measures. This study introduces a multi-layered analytical framework that integrates experimental walking, momentary perception tracking, and machine learning to investigate how multisensory urban features shape restoration.
