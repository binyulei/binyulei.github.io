excerpt: >
    Urban comfort is a means of measuring the dynamic quality of urban life as an outcome of the interaction between humans and urban environments, capturing spatio-temporal phenomena in cities. We design a multidimensional urban comfort framework encompassing 44 features, to comprehensively represent urban living environments, based on 3D urban morphology, socio-economic features, human perception, and environmental factors. We develop a graph-based approach to measure urban comfort through an index and explain its driving forces by exploiting spatial relationships between urban comfort and surrounding features. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is leveraged to interpret feature importance and inherent complexity in urban contexts, advancing conventional methods that are limited to linear relationships. We implement the framework in Amsterdam, generating a city-wide comfort index.
