excerpt: >
    Cities are supported by multiple, interacting networks, most prominently streets, which channel movement and economic exchange, and, in many contexts, waterways, which regulate flows of goods, people, and environmental amenities. Conventional quantitative studies of urban form have tended to privilege streets alone, limiting their ability to capture the full spatial logic of the urban fabric. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Graph Autoen-coder (HeterGAE) that jointly embeds street and waterway systems, providing a unified, graph-based representation of urban form.
