excerpt: >
    Humans can play a more active role in improving their comfort in the built environment if given the right information at the right place and time. This paper outlines the use of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) implemented in the context of the built environment to provide information that helps humans minimize the impact of heat and noise on their daily lives. This framework is based on the open-source Cozie iOS smartwatch platform. It includes data collection through micro-surveys and intervention messages triggered by environmental, contextual, and personal history conditions. An eight-month deployment of the method was completed in Singapore with 103 participants who submitted more than 12,000 micro-surveys and had more than 3,600 JITAI intervention messages delivered to them.
