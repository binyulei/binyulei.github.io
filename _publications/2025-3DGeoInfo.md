collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-3DGeoInfo
excerpt: >
    Adopting 3D City Index, a comprehensive 3D data scoring framework encompassing four categories—data portals, model descriptions, thematic content, and semantic information, we assess and benchmark currently available 3D city models made accessible openly by governments worldwide. The 2025 update, including 47 datasets, reveals both the current situation and advancements in the open 3D data landscape since the previous benchmark 3 years ago.
