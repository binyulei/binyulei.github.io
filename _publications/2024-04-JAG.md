excerpt: >
    This paper brings a comprehensive systematic review of the application of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography studies, including the subdomains of cultural, economic, political, historical, urban, population, social, health, rural, regional, tourism, behavioural, environmental and transport geography. In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains.
