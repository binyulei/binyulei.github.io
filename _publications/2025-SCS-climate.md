excerpt: >
    Recognising the increasing complexities posed by climate challenges to urban environments, it is crucial to develop holistic capabilities for urban areas to effectively respond to climate-related risks, forming the backbone of sustainable urban planning strategies and demanding a comprehensive understanding of urban climate justice. It requires a thorough examination of how climate change exacerbates social, economic, and environmental inequalities within urban settings, which requires a series of sophisticated spatial modellings and relies on data collected periodically. This paper introduces a novel dual-GNN approach, Multi-Hyper Graph Neural Network (MHGNN), with street view imagery as input. The proposed model integrates a multigraph and a hypergraph to model intricate spatial patterns for classifying urban climate justice.
