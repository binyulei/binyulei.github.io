### About the project

Urban digital twins, and 3D city models underpinning them, provide novel solutions to urban management but tend to overlook the human element. The trending research on human perception reveals people’s perspective towards interpreting and experiencing the built environment.

This work is the first instance of integrating such attributes in 3D city models, which have traditionally been confined to physical and objective measures. The visual perception of each building is evaluated based on building images extracted from street view images. We add such information as new attributes to an existing CityJSON dataset representing thousands of 3D buildings in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. To facilitate a robust and sustainable integration, we develop a CityJSON Extension to accommodate the new data and validate its schema successfully, and we visualise the semantic 3D dataset.
