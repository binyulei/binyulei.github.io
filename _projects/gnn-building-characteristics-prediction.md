excerpt: >
    Building characteristics, such as storeys and types, play an important role across a multitude of domain. However, geospatial data on the building stock is often fragmented and incomplete.
    
    Here, we propose a novel method to predict a set of building characteristics within diverse contexts, addressing the existing data gaps. Our method exploits the geospatial connectivity between street-level contexts and building stocks, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modelling spatial patterns to infer multiple building characteristics.
