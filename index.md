Welcome! I’m **Binyu Lei**, Assistant Professor at University of Birmingham Dubai.  
My research sits at the intersection of **urban digital twins**, **3D city models**, and **human-centric analytics**.  
I recently completed my PhD at NUS, where I focused on comfort modeling and geospatial intelligence.
